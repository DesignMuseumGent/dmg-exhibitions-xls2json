Convert Excel-spreadsheet to json

## Instruction
main.py converts the Excel spreadsheet found in data/ to json-items.

The spreadsheet was not altered: the script repeats the errors made in the spreadsheet, fe. 'TITEL NL ' is used as column header, altough it should be fixed at the source.

## Inspiration
Json-items comply to an ExhibitionEvent of schema.org
